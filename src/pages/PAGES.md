# AGENTS.md

- Use this directory for page-level application composition.
- Compose pages from `features` and `shared` rather than implementing feature behavior directly.
- Keep business logic and feature-specific state inside the appropriate feature.
- Do not place reusable, feature-agnostic code in this directory.
- Page code may depend on `features` and `shared`, but must not depend on `app`.
