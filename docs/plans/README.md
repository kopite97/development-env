# Plans

This file tracks the execution order and status of project plans.

## Status

- `proposed` — proposed but not yet approved
- `active` — approved and currently being executed
- `completed` — implemented and successfully validated
- `rejected` — cancelled, explicitly rejected, superseded, or unable to reasonably continue

At most one plan may be `active` at a time.

Both plans were registered as proposed on 2026-09-10. The user explicitly requested creating and immediately executing these plans in that session; this is authorization for their sequential activation.

PLAN-0003 was explicitly requested as completed on 2026-09-13; its remaining stabilization scope is retained for historical reference and no new execution scope was opened by PLAN-0009.

PLAN-0004 was separately registered as proposed, activated under the user's explicit request to immediately execute items 11 and 12, and completed on 2026-09-10.

PLAN-0006 was relocated from the backend proposal on 2026-09-13 and explicitly approved for execution on that date. All six sessions completed on 2026-09-13 with final evidence recorded in the Plan. Its frontend file is the single source of truth.

PLAN-0007 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-13 for Plan creation only. Explicitly approved and activated on 2026-09-13, including all contract approval candidates; all six sessions completed on that date with final validation evidence recorded in the Plan. PLAN-0006 remains completed.

PLAN-0008 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-13 for Plan creation only. Explicitly approved and activated on 2026-09-13, including all approval candidates and temporary Task-only Home behavior. All six sessions completed on that date with final validation evidence in the Plan. Existing Task UI and legacy storage are preserved. Other Plan statuses remain unchanged.

PLAN-0009 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-13 for Plan creation only, then explicitly approved and activated on that date, including all contract candidates and the authenticated Home recent-Journal surface: read-only, newest-first, default limit three unless an explicit limit exists, with no Dashboard API or saved-layout authority. All six sessions completed with final validation evidence recorded in the Plan; existing Journal UI and legacy storage remain preserved and isolated.

PLAN-0010 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-13 for Plan creation only. Live generated OpenAPI and current backend source were inspected; the user subsequently approved all candidates and read-only unity/open/default-two Home behavior. All six sessions completed with final validation and recovery evidence in the Plan; legacy storage remains untouched and no backend changes or Dashboard API integration were introduced. Existing completed Plan statuses remain unchanged.

PLAN-0011 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-14 for Plan creation only. Live generated OpenAPI and current backend source were verified. Explicitly approved and activated on 2026-09-14 with all candidates; all six sessions completed with final validation and recovery evidence recorded in the Plan. Existing Link ordering/UI and legacy storage are preserved; no backend or Dashboard API changes. Other completed Plan statuses remain unchanged.

PLAN-0012 was registered as `proposed` on 2026-09-14 for Plan creation only. Live generated Dashboard OpenAPI and current backend source were verified. Explicitly approved and activated on 2026-09-14 with all compatibility candidates; all six sessions completed with final validation and recovery evidence in the Plan. Home now uses Dashboard authority while preserving its UI and legacy storage. Existing completed statuses remain unchanged.

PLAN-0013 was registered as `proposed`, explicitly approved with all candidates, activated and completed on 2026-09-14. All six sessions completed against the running backend contract; final validation, recovery and pre-existing global formatting baseline evidence is recorded in the Plan. Category filtering and Dashboard Category configuration remain deferred. All other Plan statuses remain unchanged.

PLAN-0014 was registered as `proposed`, explicitly approved with its UI candidates, activated and completed on 2026-09-15. All seven sessions completed against the verified v2 contract, including real Category login restoration, freshness/replay checks and responsive parity. Final evidence and the existing global formatting baseline are recorded in the Plan. The scope-preservation/deferred-filtering direction of PLAN-0013 is historical, not the target of PLAN-0014. Other Plan statuses remain unchanged.

## Rules

- Execute plans in the order listed above unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Treat the `active` plan as the current source of implementation work.
- Move a plan to `completed` only after its required validation succeeds.

* Move a plan to `rejected` when it is cancelled, explicitly rejected, superseded, or unable to reasonably continue.
* Temporary implementation or validation failures do not make a plan `rejected` if they can reasonably be resolved.

- Keep this file updated whenever a plan is added, activated, completed, rejected, or reordered.
